1. scripts are not allowed to change non-script memory directly

2. scripts are not allowed to allocate, free or reallocate memory used by game structs 
   like blockstrs, animstrs, maparrays, players ... 

   if script needs own static memory then it should declare own global static array or variables

   script could dynamically allocate own memory by calling malloc & free,
   but script is responsible for handling errors and freeing his memory !
   
   if script needs to dynamically add block structures or anim structures then 
   place for them must be prepared in mapeditor (in form of unused blocks or anims)
     ! anim structures have alocated array of 4-bytes long pointers to block structures
       if you need to rescale animation length you need to prepare own animation with needed length in mapeditor

   deleting of structures is not allowed, simply stop using them in map

3. scripts should not search whole map via smGetMapBlock, instead use search functions
